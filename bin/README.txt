The bin folder should contain all of your stand-alone python scripts and should contain only executable python code with files ending in .py.  If you are working on a shared library file which you plan on importing into multiple scripts you should place it within the ../lib/ directory.  You should also follow the example lib scheme making a folder with the name of the shared library and your code residing in a __init__.py file within that folder.
